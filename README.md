<h1>Etch-a-Sketch</h1>

<h2>Things that I learned;</h2>

- Learned how to set a parameter and use arguments of a for loop in order to change the size of the board
- Learned a bit more on some use cases of template literals by being able to dynamically change the sizes of each square created in the for loop by defining the size parameter
- Learned a use case of mouseover by adding the transition and background color changes to each square as it is moused over
